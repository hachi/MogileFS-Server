Description: scalable distributed filesystem from Danga Interactive
 MogileFS is an open-source, application-level distributed filesystem. It
 creates a host-neutral, filesystem-agnostic method of distributing files
 that has many advantages over NFS and single-machine raid.  This set
 of utilities is very scalable and can handle Livejournal.com's load, for
 which it was designed.
