=head1 NAME

mogilefsd -- MogileFS tracker daemon

=head1 USAGE

This is the main MogileFS daemon, mogilefsd, also called the
"tracker".  All interaction with a MogileFS installation begins by a
client talking to a tracker (you should run several in parallel for
redundancy).

See L<MogileFS::Client> for a client library.

=head1 ARCHITECTURE

=head2 Processes

The mogilefsd daemon is an event-loop in the parent process, handling
with epoll/kqueue/etc (see L<Danga::Socket>) tons of client
connections, while managing a bunch of worker processes underneath.

The worker processes under mogilefsd include:

=over 4

=item B<Client query processing> -- implements the MogileFS client/server protocol

See L<MogileFS::Worker::Query>.

=item B<Monitoring> -- monitors hosts and devices

See L<MogileFS::Worker::Monitor>.

=item B<Replicate> -- replicates files

See L<MogileFS::Worker::Replicate>.

=item B<Deleter> -- deletes files from storage nodes (protocol deletes from namespace are immediate)

See L<MogileFS::Worker::Delete>.

=item B<Reaper> -- re-enqueues files for replication when disks are marked dead

See L<MogileFS::Worker::Reaper>.

=item B<Checker/Fsck> -- background filesystem consistency checker

See L<MogileFS::Worker::Checker>.
